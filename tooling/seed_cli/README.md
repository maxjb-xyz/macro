# Seed CLI

Used to populate your local environment with sample data.

Please ensure you have read [RUNNING\_LOCALLY](../../docs/RUNNING_LOCALLY.md) and
have your local environment setup.

## Usage
You can explore the CLI and it's usage with `just seed help`. All commands can 
be run through the `just seed` base command.

## Scenarios

A scenario file describes a complete world — users, teams, channels, and
entities (documents, tasks, projects, chats, calls, emails, messages) with the
access edges between them — so varied permission patterns are testable
locally. Tasks are markdown documents with the task subtype plus status and
assignee properties (and an optional share-with-team grant). See
`tooling/seed_cli/seed/scenarios/team-perms.json` for the reference example.

```bash
# From the repository root (postgres + localstack must be up):
just seed-scenario apply --file tooling/seed_cli/seed/scenarios/team-perms.json
just seed-scenario matrix --file tooling/seed_cli/seed/scenarios/team-perms.json
just seed-scenario status --file tooling/seed_cli/seed/scenarios/team-perms.json  # or no --file
just seed-scenario reset --file tooling/seed_cli/seed/scenarios/team-perms.json   # or --all

# Target a named `run_local --instance 2508` stack.
just seed-scenario --instance 2508 apply --file tooling/seed_cli/seed/scenarios/team-perms.json
```

- `apply` deletes the scenario's own rows first and re-seeds, so it always
  converges on the config. Every seeded id is derived from
  `(scenario, kind, key)` and starts with the `5eed` marker — rows created
  through the app (random ids) are never touched, though content living
  inside a seeded container dies with it on re-apply (e.g. messages you sent
  in a seeded channel, which is recreated).
- `apply --force` is the pristine-world variant: it drops the local database
  entirely, re-runs migrations, and then seeds — everything goes, organic
  data included. Open the printed persona links afterwards to log back in.
- `matrix` computes the expected access level for every (user, entity) pair
  from the config and verifies it against the live database using the real
  `entity_access` service; it exits non-zero on any mismatch.
- `status` is read-only: with `--file` it reports which of the scenario's
  rows are present (per kind, with missing keys), whether the FusionAuth
  accounts and sync-service content exist, and re-prints the persona login
  links. Without `--file` it discovers every applied scenario by its id
  marker and reports on the ones matching a file in `seed/scenarios/`.
  Scenarios with distinct names (and distinct user emails) coexist in one
  database — ids are namespaced by a hash of the scenario name.
- `reset` deletes exactly the rows carrying the scenario's id marker, plus
  (with `--file`) the scenario's user accounts by email. `reset --all` cannot
  know emails, so accounts created through the signup webhook survive it.
- `apply` creates each user's FusionAuth account first (the signup webhook
  writes the base rows, which the seeder then adopts), so every seeded user
  can log in through the real passwordless flow. If FusionAuth is
  unreachable, apply seeds database rows only and says so.
- To drive several personas at once in one browser window, open the links
  apply prints (`http://alice.localhost:3000/app/login?email=…`) as plain
  tabs. Hostnames get separate cookie jars (ports don't), the app follows the
  page hostname to the backend proxy, and locally the login completes itself
  (the local backend returns the one-time code and dev builds auto-submit
  it) — so each link logs its persona straight in, one live session per tab
  against the same stack. For manual logins outside a dev build, the one-time
  codes land in mailpit (`just status_local` prints its UI address).

## Self-host bootstrap

For a fresh self-host deploy, `docker/selfhost/compose.seed.yml` runs a
one-shot `scenario bootstrap` service that migrates the database (idempotent)
and applies the bundled `seed/scenarios/bootstrap.json` scenario (admin user +
team workspace + document + channel).

```bash
docker compose -f compose.yml -f docker/selfhost/compose.seed.yml up -d
```

The command is gated by `SEED_BOOTSTRAP=true` and, unlike the local scenario
commands, is not pinned to the `user`/`macrodb` local database. Optional env
overrides for the bundled admin user:

- `SEED_ADMIN_EMAIL` — default `admin@seed.macro.local`; set to the operator's
  own mailbox so passwordless login delivers a readable code.
- `SEED_ADMIN_FIRST_NAME`, `SEED_ADMIN_LAST_NAME` — display name.

Pass `--file <scenario.json>` to apply a custom scenario instead of the
bundled one.
